# Personal-Projects

This is a display of a few of my personal projects.

I have experience in developing Android apps both as personal projects and working in teams to develops apps used by hundreds of students.
I have learned Java, C, R, and ARM assembly language in classes while studying at Purdue.
In Java, I have worked on personal projects including web scraping and making calculators. I have also completed classwork in Java that included work alone and in groups.
In C, I have finished classwork including smaller assignments, and a large project divided into 2-week sprints to parse HTML pages in C.
In R, I have completed classwork that involved summarizing large datasets and interpreting the outputs.
